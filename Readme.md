# Repository Name

This repository contains all the necessary details and codebase for [brief description of the project]. It's structured to facilitate easy setup and subsequent updates.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the process of setting up the repository on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have git installed on your machine. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

### Initial Clone and Setup

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up your local environment for the first time:

1. **Clone the repository**
   - Use the SSH method to clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone git@github.com:github_name/your_name.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the repository directory:
     ```bash
     cd your_name
     ```

2. **Verify the remote URL**
   - Ensure that the SSH URL is correctly set:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```

3. **Create a new branch**
   - It's a good practice to create a new branch for your changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b branch_name
     ```

## Making Changes

Once you've set up the repository locally, follow these steps to make and push changes:

### Adding and Committing Changes

1. **Add your changes**
   - Add all modified files to the staging area:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```

2. **Commit your changes**
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Update title or description of what was changed"
     ```

### Pushing Changes

1. **Push changes to GitHub**
   - Push your branch to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin branch_name
     ```

## Subsequent Updates

For subsequent updates, you do not need to clone the repository again. Just pull the latest changes, create a new branch, and repeat the steps in the "Making Changes" section.

### Pulling Latest Changes

1. **Pull the latest changes from remote**
   - Ensure you are on the correct branch and your working directory is clean:
     ```bash
     git checkout main
     git pull
     ```

2. **Create a new branch for new changes**
   - Always work on a new branch:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b new_feature_branch
     ```

Repeat the steps under "Adding and Committing Changes" and "Pushing Changes" for your new work.
